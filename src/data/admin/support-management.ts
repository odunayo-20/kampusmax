// ============================================================
// SUPPORT / CUSTOMER SERVICE DATASET (Module 56)
// ============================================================
//
// Deterministic seed dataset for the /admin/support console.
// Tickets reference REAL users, orders, vendors and jobs from the
// existing stores (same identity space as /admin/users, /admin/orders,
// /admin/marketplace and /admin/jobs), so every related-resource link
// on the detail page resolves to a live admin page.
//
// NO real ticket data exists in this prototype (there is no backend -
// see KAMPUSMAX_SUPPORT_BACKEND_GAPS.md). This file is the prototype's
// single swap point: a future NestJS support module returns the same
// DTO shapes and the factory in support-management.service.ts replaces
// the store reads with HTTP calls. Metrics are DERIVED from the ticket
// store, never hardcoded statistics.
