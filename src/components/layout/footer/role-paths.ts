/**
 * Kampmax role pathways — single source of truth for the "Join Kampmax"
 * messaging (footer, homepage role CTA, signup role step, public footer).
 *
 * Only routes that actually exist are referenced. Guests and existing
 * members get different destinations:
 *   - `guestHref`  -> the existing guest-accessible onboarding/registration
 *                     pathway for that role.
 *   - `memberHref` -> the existing dashboard/profile area for members who
 *                     already hold the profile (role dashboards enforce their
 *                     own access gates; client state never authorizes them).
 *
 * The backend auth contract exposes `UserRole = "student" | "vendor" | "admin"`
 * only; freelancer / service-provider / employer are profile-activation
 * onboards under one account. This file does NOT claim roles the backend
 * cannot issue.
