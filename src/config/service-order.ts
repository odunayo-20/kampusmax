// ============================================================
// SERVICE ORDER (BOOKING) CENTRALIZED CONFIGURATION  (Module 19)
// ============================================================
//
// Single source of truth for order-fulfillment presentation constants
// shared by the booking engine and its UI. Keeps status-table nuances,
// labels, tones, category rules, and upload limits in one place so
// components and the backend store never hard-code presentation values.
//
// ARCHITECTURE & SECURITY:
//   - This file is presentation/rule metadata ONLY. Status transitions are
//     ALWAYS decided by the backend store (src/data/booking.ts). The UI may
//     hide or disable actions based on these constants, but never mutates a
//     status directly.
//   - Category rules (which services require completion confirmation or
//     allow completion evidence) live here so the backend store and the UI
//     agree by construction.
